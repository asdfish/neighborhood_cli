* Neighborhood cli

** Usage

To use most of the sub commands, you will first need to authenticate yourself.

#+begin_src shell
  # Send otp to username@email.provider.com
  neighborhood_cli auth send username@email.provider.com
  # Login to `username@email.provider.com` with the otp of `1234`
  neighborhood_cli auth login username@email.provider.com 1234
#+end_src

Then run ~neighborhood_cli help~ to see all subcommands.

** Recommendations

Since the name ~neighborhood_cli~ is very long, it is recommended to either make an alias for the command or rename the executable.
