* Usage

To use most of the sub commands, you will first need to authenticate yourself.

#+begin_src shell
  # Send otp to EMAIL
  neighborhood_cli auth <EMAIL> send
  # Login to `EMAIL` the otp of `INT`
  neighborhood_cli auth <EMAIL> login <INT>
#+end_src

Then run ~neighborhood_cli help~ to see all subcommands.

** Devlogs

You can post devlogs with
#+begin_src shell
  neighborhood_cli devlog --app <STRING> --message <STRING> --photobooth <PATH> --demo <PATH>
#+end_src

* Recommendations

Since the name ~neighborhood_cli~ is very long, it is recommended to either make an alias for the command or rename the executable.
